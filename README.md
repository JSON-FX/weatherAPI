Laravel Weather App
This is a simple Laravel application that allows users to enter their name, email, and location to retrieve the current weather information for the specified location. The application uses the WeatherAPI to fetch weather data and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

PHP (^7.3|^8.0)
Composer
Node.js
NPM
Installation
Clone the repository:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/laravel-weather-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code
cd laravel-weather-app
Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

Copy code
composer install
Install JavaScript dependencies using NPM:

Copy code
npm install
Create a copy of the .env.example file and rename it to .env:

Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Generate an application key:

Copy code
php artisan key:generate
Open the .env file and update the WEATHER_API_KEY with your WeatherAPI key:

Copy code
WEATHER_API_KEY=your-weatherapi-key
Compile the assets using Laravel Mix:

Copy code
npm run dev
Start the development server:

Copy code
php artisan serve
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000 to see the application running.
Tailwind CSS Setup
This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The necessary dependencies are already installed, but you need to compile the CSS file. Follow these steps:

Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:

Copy code
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
Create a Tailwind configuration file:

Copy code
npx tailwindcss init
Open the tailwind.config.js file and add the following content:
javascript


Copy code
module.exports = {
  purge: [
    './resources/**/*.blade.php',
    './resources/**/*.js',
    './resources/**/*.vue',
  ],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
  ],
}
Open the resources/css/app.css file and replace its content with the following:
css


Copy code
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
Compile the assets:

Copy code
npm run dev
Now your Laravel application is set up with Tailwind CSS, and you can use Tailwind classes in your views.

Usage
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000.
Fill in the form with your name, email, and location.
